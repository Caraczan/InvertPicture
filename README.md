# NegatePictures
invert.py is a simply script that inverts colors in pictures in directory where script is.<br />
Script uses system command mkdir and magick from ImageMagick in this script.Python3 also requires os, os.path libraries which should be by default.<br />

Tested for Mac only, pretty sure it would work on linuxes too.<br /> 

**Dependencies:**
1. [Python3](https://www.python.org)
2. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)

How does it work?<br />
First make sure you have installed python3 and ImageMagick (links above).<br /> 
Now put it together with pictures you want to invert,<br />
and now just run script ```python3 invert.py``` and wait a moment.<br />
New folder will be created, all inverted pictures will be put there, and thats all.<br />
